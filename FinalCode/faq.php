                            <p>Exercise generally lowers blood sugar by increasing insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by muscles. However, intense exercise can temporarily raise levels. Monitor your levels before and after exercise to understand your body’s response.</p>

                            <p>For low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), consume 15 grams of fast-acting carbs, such as glucose tablets, juice, or candy. Recheck your levels after 15 minutes and repeat if needed. Seek medical help if symptoms persist.</p>
